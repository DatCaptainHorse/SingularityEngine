## Status

[![Build](https://github.com/DatCaptainHorse/SingularityEngine/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/DatCaptainHorse/SingularityEngine/actions/workflows/build.yml)

In progress of bringing in "good bits" from old, private version of engine and modulizing and rewriting the code.

## Introduction

Singularity Engine is an open-source game/application engine written in C++

The engine aims to use latest C++ and features, currently targeting C++20 with modules.

This project can be used for learning and experimenting purposes,
while things are kept clean, don't expect a super-serious environment.

## History

Singularity Engine started many years back as a learning project for C++

The engine was initially based on [Sparky Game Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Sparky),
but once the project took it's own path any relation to Sparky was quickly gone.

The project grew larger and new features were constantly added, it was too much for one person.
Thus decision was made to rewrite Singularity Engine as a public open-source project,
preserving some of the "good bits" from original private version.
